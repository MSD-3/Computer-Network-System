# Computer-Network-System

Classless IPv4 implementation with support for subnetting along with Dotted Decimal and Binary Representation of address simulated using the concepts of Object Oriented Programming and written in C++.

## Functionality of the program

1. Uses the concept of IPv4 addressing to generate Network ID , Network Mask and Network DBA with input of number of hosts and example of an IP address.

2. The program generates all possible IP addreses in the program and storing it in a text file (GeneratedIP.txt).

3. The user inputs the number of subnets required in the network and number of hosts required in individual subnet.

4. The program uses Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) to generate required Subnet ID and Subnet Mask for each subnet.

5. It stores all the ip addresses of each subnet seperately in GeneratedIP.txt.

6. It displays a Network Address Translation (NAT) Table at the end.
